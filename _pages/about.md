I am currently a Ph.D. student advised by Porf. [Tianyi Chen](https://chentianyi1991.github.io/) at [RPI](https://www.rpi.edu/). I was fortunate to join Prof. Tianyi Chen's group as the first Ph.D. student and grow with the research group till today. At the institute, my research generally focuses on algorihthm development for machine learning, especially from the perspective of optimization.

I worked on safety fine-tuning of LLMs as a research scientist intern mentored by [Pin-Yu Chen](https://sites.google.com/site/pinyuchenpage/) and under the management of [Payel Das](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=1vs31MgAAAAJ&hl=en) in 2024 summer. 
Prior to this, I also worked on offline reinforcement learning algorithms as a research scientist intern at [IBM Research AI](https://research.ibm.com/artificial-intelligence) mentored by [Songtao Lu](https://sites.google.com/site/lusongtaoee) and [Xiaodong Cui](https://research.ibm.com/people/xiaodong-cui).

## Research


My research spans the areas of optimization algorithms and machine learning, covering the following topics:

* <b> Bilevel learning </b> Bilevel learning is a general learning framework covering a wide range of topics--adversarial learning, hyper-parameter optimization, meta learning, etc. Our research focuses on the the theory foundation and algorithm design for bilevel training. We aim to advance and improve over the current single-level training paradigm with bilevel training framework.

* <b> Reinforcement learning </b> Solving reinforcement learning problems with both online or offline policy optimization algorithms, along with recent focus on AI alginment with reinforcement learning from human feedback.

* <b> Multi-objective learning </b> Learn multiple things like multiple objective functions, datasets, modalities efficiently.
