I earned my Ph.D. from [RPI](https://www.rpi.edu/) in December 2024 under the supervision of Dr. [Tianyi Chen](https://chentianyi1991.github.io/). I was fortunate to join Dr. Tianyi Chen's group as the first Ph.D. student and to grow with the research group until my graduation. At the institute, my research primarily focused on optimization algorihthm for machine learning and reinforcement learning, with applications to LLM post-training and more.

After graduation, I joined [Ant Group](https://www.antgroup.com/en)'s top talent program [Ant Star](https://talent.antgroup.com/ant-star), where I currently work on LLM post-training algorithms with strong safety guarantees.
Prior to this, I worked in [IBM Research AI](https://research.ibm.com/artificial-intelligence) as a research intern mentored by [Pin-Yu Chen](https://sites.google.com/site/pinyuchenpage/) and under the management of [Payel Das](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=1vs31MgAAAAJ&hl=en). 
I also worked on offline reinforcement learning algorithms as a research scientist intern at [IBM Research AI](https://research.ibm.com/artificial-intelligence) mentored by [Songtao Lu](https://sites.google.com/site/lusongtaoee) and [Xiaodong Cui](https://research.ibm.com/people/xiaodong-cui).

## Research


My research spans the areas of optimization algorithms and machine learning, covering the following topics:

* <b> Bilevel learning </b> Bilevel learning is a general learning framework covering a wide range of topics--adversarial learning, hyper-parameter optimization, meta learning, etc. Our research focuses on the the theory foundation and algorithm design for bilevel training. We aim to advance and improve over the current single-level training paradigm with bilevel training framework.

* <b> Reinforcement learning </b> Solving reinforcement learning problems with both online or offline policy optimization algorithms, along with recent focus on AI alginment with reinforcement learning from human feedback.

* <b> Multi-objective learning </b> Learn multiple things like multiple objective functions, datasets, modalities efficiently.
